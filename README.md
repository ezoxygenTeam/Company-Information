# Company Introduction
Established in 2016, Genius Holding advances in ultrasound technology, pioneering in passive ultrasonic gas flow velocity and volume measurement. Our technology, distinct in medical lung function testing, uses a blend of audible and ultrasonic frequencies for accurate, inertia error-free gas flow detection. This innovation facilitates swift and precise data transmission for remote healthcare applications.

- ezOxygen smart spirometer: CES 2019 award winner, enhancing home healthcare for asthma and COPD patients.

- Strategic partnership with AstraZeneca led to the 'Health Lung App', integrating AI for respiratory health. 

- Smart manufacturing, our acoustic analysis technology, as seen with Chang Chun Petrochemical (iEar project), Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (machine monitoring), Asia Vital Components (Product QA), to elevate standards in machine monitoring and quality assurance. 

We're also pioneering in ultrasonic applications, developing systems for wireless data transmission and movement monitoring in various sectors.
